# OCD-Health-Analytics

## Project Overview

### Project Title : OCD-Health-Analytics

The OCD-Health-Analytics project aims to analyze and visualize data related to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) patients. The analysis focuses on understanding patterns and correlations between OCD symptoms, depression, and anxiety diagnoses. This project leverages MySQL, Excel, and Power BI to provide insights that could be valuable for healthcare professionals and researchers in the mental health domain.

### Objectives

#### Data Analysis:
Analyze the ocd_patient_dataset to identify patterns and correlations between OCD symptoms, depression, and anxiety diagnoses.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to help interpret the data and highlight key findings.
#### Statistical Insights:
Perform statistical analysis to understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

#### • Y-BOCS Score (Obsessions): 
The severity of obsessive symptoms, measured as a double value.
#### • Y-BOCS Score (Compulsions):
The severity of compulsive symptoms, measured as an integer value.
#### • Depression Diagnosis:
A text field indicating whether the patient has been diagnosed with depression.
#### • Anxiety Diagnosis: 
A text field indicating whether the patient has been diagnosed with anxiety.


### Tools Used

• MySQL: Used for managing and querying the dataset.

• Excel: Used for creating dashboards and performing data manipulation.

• Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

### Results
The project provides insights into how OCD symptoms correlate with depression and anxiety diagnoses. Visualizations created during the analysis help in identifying trends and patterns that can be useful for further research and clinical application.

### Conclusion
OCD-Health-Analytics offers a comprehensive approach to understanding the complexities of OCD in relation to other mental health disorders. The insights derived from this project can support ongoing research and potentially guide treatment approaches.
